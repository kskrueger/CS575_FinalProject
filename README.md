Final Project: Autonomous Floor-Mapping Robot

The goal of this project is to design and program an autonomous robot to explore hallways and record distance data to create a 2D floor plan of the hallway. The robot will autonomously navigate an indoor environment, exploring unknown areas until it has completed a full map. The robot will be equipped with a 2D LiDAR sensor and a camera. The goal is to combine the data from the two sensors with the data from the motor encoders to build a floor plan of the environment. The floor map will be saved in a format that allows for visualization.
